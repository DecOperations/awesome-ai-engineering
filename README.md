List of resources helping you become a better AI engineer. 

# What's an AI Engineer? 

* [Microsoft's definition](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/career-paths/ai-engineer) "Artificial intelligence (AI) engineers are responsible for developing, programming and training the complex networks of algorithms that make up AI so that they can function like a human brain. This role requires combined expertise in software development, programming, data science and data engineering"
* [Coursera's definition](https://www.coursera.org/articles/ai-engineer) "Artificial intelligence engineers are individuals who use AI and machine learning techniques to develop applications and systems that can help organizations increase efficiency, cut costs, increase profits, and make better business decisions."
* [Tech Target](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/How-to-become-an-artificial-intelligence-engineer) "AI engineers develop, program and train the complex networks of algorithms that encompass AI so those algorithms can work like a human brain. AI engineers must be experts in software development, data science, data engineering and programming."

# What's the difference between an AI Engineer and a Machine Learning Engineer?

* [UpWork](https://www.upwork.com/resources/ai-engineer-vs-ml-engineer#:~:text=AI%20engineers%20work%20on%20a,predictions%20from%20large%20data%20sets.) "AI engineers work on a broader set of tasks that encompass various forms of machine intelligence, like neural networks, to develop AI models for specific applications. In contrast, ML engineers focus more on ML algorithms and models that can self-tune to better learn and make predictions from large data sets."

# What's the difference between an AI Engineer and a Software Engineer? 
* [IEEE](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/so/2022/06/09928183/1HJux2cbygM) ChatGPT's summary of that page "**AI engineers blend traditional software engineering skills with a deep understanding of machine learning and artificial intelligence** to develop systems that enhance decision-making and automation within organizations. They are proficient in AI technologies and statistical analysis, focusing on building and integrating AI models into applications. On the other hand, software engineers focus broadly on designing, implementing, and maintaining software systems, with a comprehensive grasp of the software development lifecycle, from requirement analysis to deployment and maintenance. The distinction is further marked by the AI engineer's need to navigate emerging AI technologies, whereas software engineers adhere to established engineering principles and practices across various platforms and technologies"
